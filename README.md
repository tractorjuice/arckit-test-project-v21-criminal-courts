# Criminal Courts Technology & AI Reform

An architecture governance project using [ArcKit](https://github.com/tractorjuice/arc-kit) to analyse technology problems and propose solutions for the **Independent Review of the Criminal Courts** (Leveson Review, 2025-2026).

## Background

The Lord Chancellor commissioned Sir Brian Leveson to conduct an independent review of the criminal courts in England and Wales. With 77,000+ outstanding Crown Court cases and a fragmented digital landscape, the review identified technology and AI as critical enablers for reform.

## Project Scope

This project focuses on the **technology and AI aspects** of the review's recommendations:

| Area | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **AI for Case Preparation** | Summarising prosecution case details, disclosure assistance |
| **AI Translation** | Real-time translation of court proceedings |
| **CPS Decision Support** | AI-enhanced charging and case management decisions |
| **Common Platform Evolution** | Central digital case management for all criminal courts |
| **Legacy Migration** | Moving 37 critical applications to modern platforms |
| **Fines Modernisation** | Opal system replacing legacy criminal fines tools |
| **Cross-Agency Integration** | Connecting police, CPS, courts, probation, and prisons |
